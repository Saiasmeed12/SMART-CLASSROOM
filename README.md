An offline-first smart classroom web application designed to help students learn more effectively by converting audio lectures and PDF documents into structured summaries and automated
assessments, the system works without cloud APIs, making it suitable for low-connectivity environments.


=> HOW IT WORKS

❖User uploads an audio file or PDF document.

❖The system extracts text (audio → transcription, PDF → text).

❖Extracted content is processed to generate:

• A summary

• MCQs and Fill-in-the-Blanks questions.

• User attempts the quiz and receives:
• Score
• Percentage
• Performance feedback.
